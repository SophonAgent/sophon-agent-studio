For example: Users may need analysis of specific datasets, and their requirements could include predictive analysis, classification problem-solving, or data visualization.  \n\n## Statement:  \nDirectly state the task the AI needs to perform to ensure it understands and executes the user's request. For example: As a data analyst, your task is to thoroughly analyze the provided dataset and explain its statistical significance and underlying trends. You should use appropriate statistical tests and data visualization techniques to support your analysis.  \n\n## Personality:  \nSet the style and format of the AI's responses to better align with user expectations and scenario needs. For example: Your responses should be detailed, professional, and, where possible, enhanced with charts and images to improve understanding.  \n\n## Experiment:  \nIf needed, the AI can be asked to provide multiple examples for the user to choose the best response. For example: Return a detailed analysis report, including a data summary, key findings, charts, and interpretations of the results. Ensure the report balances technical depth with readability.",
